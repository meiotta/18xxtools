## Why this doc exists

The first cut of the Steps panel exposed engine class names (`Engine::Step::WaterfallAuction`, etc.) as a flat picker, with a bare ordered list and disabled buttons. Anthony pushed back: a designer building a game does not think *"I want `Engine::Step::HomeToken` in my OR step array."* They think *"I have a corporation with no fixed home location, and the game needs to know what to do when it floats."*

The realization: **most of the operating-round / stock-round / init-round step list should be derived from the rest of the game's design**, not picked manually. The user configures their companies (Jenny), their phases (Farrah), their game-end rules (Evan) — and the steps panel reflects what those choices imply.

This document is the spec for that inference, the cross-panel feedback contract, and the override surface.

---

## 1. The two-tier model

Inside one round's step array, every step falls into one of two groups (verified against `lib/engine/step/base.rb` + the step's `blocks?` method):

### Group A — "Available throughout the turn" (non-blocking)
- `blocks? == false`
- Contributes an action to the player's UI but does *not* gate round progression.
- Order *within* this group is cosmetic — the engine doesn't care.
- Examples: `Bankrupt`, `Exchange`, `SpecialTrack`, `SpecialToken`, the early `BuyCompany`, `DiscardTrain`.

### Group B — "In sequence" (blocking)
- `blocks? == true`
- The round walks them top-to-bottom and stops at each one until the player resolves it (via the matching action or `pass`).
- Order *within* this group **is the play timeline**. Reordering changes when things happen.
- Examples (1830 OR): `HomeToken` (if pending) → `Track` → `Token` → `Route` → `Dividend` → `DiscardTrain` → `BuyTrain` → `[BuyCompany, {blocks: true}]`.

The panel UI must visually distinguish these two groups. Reorder controls only make sense in Group B.

## 2. The inference rules table

This is the v0 mapping. Every entry must be reviewed by the upstream panel's owner before it ships.

| # | Trigger (state predicate)                                                                | Inferred entry                                                  | Group | Round    | Owner of trigger | Notes |
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | `state.mechanics.bankruptcyAllowed === true`                                             | `Engine::Step::Bankrupt`                                        | A     | OR       | Evan             | Already a mechanics toggle; canonical. |
| 2 | `state.privates[].abilities[].type === 'tile_lay'` (any private)                          | `Engine::Step::SpecialTrack`                                    | A     | OR + SR  | Jenny            | Also fires for `teleport` ability per `step/special_track.rb:158`. |
| 3 | `state.privates[].abilities[].type === 'token'` (any private)                             | `Engine::Step::SpecialToken`                                    | A     | OR       | Jenny            | |
| 4 | `state.privates[].abilities[].type === 'exchange'` (any private)                          | `Engine::Step::Exchange`                                        | A     | OR + SR  | Jenny            | Both rounds: `step/exchange.rb` is mounted in both 1830's OR and SR step lists. |
| 5 | Any corp/minor with `coordinates` empty/null OR with multiple `home_token_locations`     | `Engine::Step::HomeToken`                                       | B     | OR       | Jenny            | See §3 below for the second case (reserved-tile deferred placement). |
| 6 | Any reserved hex on the map AND owning corp has `coordinates` set to it                   | `Engine::Step::HomeToken`                                       | B     | OR       | Max (map) + Jenny | Also queues `pending_tokens` per `base.rb:1685`. |
| 7 | Any phase has `status: ['can_buy_companies']` OR `'can_buy_companies_from_other_players'`| `Engine::Step::BuyCompany` (early, non-blocking)                | A     | OR       | Farrah           | The trailing `[BuyCompany, {blocks:true}]` is separate — see §4. |
| 8 | `state.mechanics.orSteps.issueShares === true` (or replacement flag once migrated)        | `Engine::Step::IssueShares`                                     | A     | OR       | Evan             | Used by 18Chesapeake, 1846, 1817. |
| 9 | Any phase declares `status: ['limited_train_buy']`                                       | `Engine::Step::SingleDepotTrainBuy` (replaces `BuyTrain`)       | B     | OR       | Farrah           | Mutually exclusive with default `BuyTrain`. |
| 10 | Any private with `abilities[].type === 'no_buy'` OR concession-with-exchange present     | `Engine::Step::ConcessionAuction` instead of `WaterfallAuction` | A     | Initial  | Jenny            | Drives the Initial round class choice too — Tim's surface. |
| 11 | `state.mechanics.merger.enabled === true` (or `state.mechanics.rounds.merger != null`)   | Merger sub-tab unlocks; specific `Step::Merge*` entries appear  | B     | Merger   | Evan + Tim       | Custom round class required (`G<game>::Round::Merger`); see Tim's PR1a. |
| 12 | Always (default in every game)                                                            | `Engine::Step::DiscardTrain`                                    | A     | OR + SR  | (universal)      | Fires only when a corp is over train_limit; safe default. |
| 13 | Always (default in every game)                                                            | `Engine::Step::EndGame`                                         | A     | OR       | Evan             | Manual end-game declaration; non-blocking, harmless to include. |
| 14 | Game uses player loans (e.g. 1817, 1856) — `state.mechanics.loans.enabled`               | `G<game>::Step::Loan` + `G<game>::Step::PostConversionLoans`    | B     | OR       | Evan + Tim       | Game-specific subclass required — Tim's surface. |

**Game-specific entries that the inference cannot derive** and must be hand-added by the user with provenance `'manual'`: per-game custom steps like `G1822::Step::FirstTurnHousekeeping`, `G1822::Step::AcquireCompany`, etc.

### Open questions for the table

- **Q1 (Jenny):** Do you have a canonical list of ability `type:` values your panel emits? If new ability types appear that aren't in this table, the inference will silently drop them.
- **Q2 (Farrah):** Is there a single canonical map of phase-status string → engine-step-class? I've inferred a partial one above; please verify and extend.
- **Q3 (Evan):** Several entries reference `state.mechanics.orSteps` toggles (issueShares, etc.) — are those still the source of truth, or do they get migrated into `state.mechanics.rounds.<type>.steps` directly during PR-migration?
- **Q4 (Tim):** For row 10 (`ConcessionAuction` replaces `WaterfallAuction`), this also drives the Initial round-class choice in your section. Want to fold this into a single inference, or keep the round-class and step-list inferences independent?

## 3. Why HomeToken needs a separate trigger row

Researched against `lib/engine/game/base.rb:1667-1703` and `lib/engine/step/tracker.rb`:

`HomeToken` fires (queues a `pending_token` that the step picks up) in two cases:
1. **Multi-home / no-home corp floats** — `place_home_token` finds either no fixed `coordinates` OR multiple `home_token_locations`, so the player must pick.
2. **Reserved-hex deferred placement** — corp's home hex is reserved by them but the tile has no paths yet (e.g. 1830's pre-printed B&O and C&O hexes); placement is queued until the tile is upgraded.

There's also a third case: `tracker.rb:update_token!` re-queues tokens when a multi-token tile gets upgraded to a new city layout. This is a runtime side-effect, not a design-time choice — but it means *any* game with reserved hexes will need `HomeToken` in the OR step list.

The table separates rows 5 and 6 because they touch different upstream owners (Jenny owns corp definitions; Max owns the map's reserved hexes).

---

## 4. The trailing blocking BuyCompany — convention vs. inference

In 1830 and many other games the OR step list ends with `[Engine::Step::BuyCompany, { blocks: true }]` as a "last-chance to buy a private" gate. This is *not* directly inferable from a single trigger — it's a design choice. Options:

- **(a)** Treat it as part of the canonical "matches base.rb default" baseline. If the user hasn't customized the OR, it's there. If they remove it, that's their explicit call.
- **(b)** Drive it from a separate flag like `state.mechanics.lastChanceBuyCompany: boolean` (default true).

Recommendation: **(a)** — it's part of the engine default and shouldn't require a separate toggle.

---

## 5. State provenance schema

To make removal-of-upstream-trigger correctly remove the inferred step (instead of leaving an orphan), each entry in `state.mechanics.rounds.<type>.steps` carries provenance:

```js
StepEntry = {
  class: string,                // Ruby class path; pass-through to _grbStepArrayLiteral
  opts?: object,                // per-entry kwargs, e.g. { blocks: true }
  source: SourceTag,            // ← new field
  pinned?: boolean,             // user explicitly froze this entry; inference can't remove
};

SourceTag =
  | 'manual'                                          // user added via picker
  | 'default'                                         // part of base.rb baseline
  | { auto: 'jenny.privates.<id>.abilities.<idx>' }   // tied to a Jenny ability
  | { auto: 'farrah.phases.<id>.status' }             // tied to a Farrah status flag
  | { auto: 'evan.mechanics.<key>' }                  // tied to an Evan toggle
  ;
```

### Behavior rules

- When the upstream source mutates such that the inference no longer fires:
  - `source: 'manual'` → entry stays.
  - `source: 'default'` → entry stays unless the user has explicitly removed it (tracked in a `removedDefaults` set on the round slot).
  - `source: { auto: '…' }` → entry is removed automatically *unless* `pinned: true`.
- When a user manually removes an entry whose source is `auto`, it gets converted to `removed` in a parallel set, and the inference engine respects that (won't re-add on the next tick).
- When a user manually adds an entry that the inference would *also* have produced, the entry's `source` is upgraded from `auto` to `manual` so it survives upstream removal.

## 6. Cross-panel feedback contract

For the panel to be trustworthy, the upstream panels must surface to their user when their mutation triggers an inference downstream. v0 contract:

| Upstream panel | When user does X | Surface this feedback |
|---|---|---|
| Jenny — Companies / Privates | Adds a `tile_lay` ability | Inline note: "→ This adds **Special Track** to Operating + Stock rounds." Link to STEPS panel. |
| Jenny — Companies / Privates | Adds a `token` ability | "→ This adds **Special Token** to Operating round." |
| Jenny — Companies / Privates | Adds an `exchange` ability | "→ This adds **Exchange** to Operating + Stock rounds." |
| Jenny — Corp pack editor | Saves a corp with empty coordinates | "→ This adds **Home Token** placement to Operating round; players will pick the home hex when the corp floats." |
| Farrah — Phases | Adds `'can_buy_companies'` to a phase's status | "→ This activates the **Buy Companies** action during Operating rounds in that phase." |
| Farrah — Phases | Adds `'limited_train_buy'` | "→ This swaps **Buy Trains** for **Single Depot Train Buy** during that phase." |
| Evan — Mechanics | Toggles `bankruptcyAllowed` off | "→ This removes **Bankrupt** from Operating rounds. Corps with no money and no train will deadlock." |
| Evan — Mechanics | Enables merger round | "→ This unlocks the **Merger** sub-tab on the Steps panel; you'll need to define merge steps and a custom round subclass." |
| Tim — Round classes | Picks a non-vanilla round class | "→ Step list semantics may differ from `Round::Operating`; review the picker after switching." |

Implementation note: the feedback is one-way for now (upstream → user-facing message). The panels do not call into each other directly. The inference engine is the central reader; each panel just emits standardized messages from a shared `_inferenceFeedbackFor(action)` helper.

---

## 7. Manual override surface

The user can:

1. **Remove a default or auto-derived entry.** Logged in `removedDefaults` / `removedAuto` sets on the round slot. Wizard surfaces a warning: *"You've removed a step the inference would have included. The game may behave unexpectedly. [Restore]"*
2. **Pin an auto-derived entry as manual.** Click "pin" on a card; entry's `source` becomes `'manual'`. Survives upstream removal.
3. **Add a step the inference didn't produce.** From the picker, with category labels (auction / SR / OR / merger / always-available). Each addition's source is `'manual'`.
4. **Add a custom subclass.** Free-text Ruby body editor (Tim's surface — round-class subclass with method overrides), referenced from the step entry as `class: 'G<game>::Step::<Name>'`.

---

## 8. The wizard

Per Anthony's spec:

- **Auto-shows on first visit** to each round sub-tab. Dismissible. Reopenable via "How does this round work?" button on the tab.
- **Plain-language explanation** of what the round is and what the steps do — the two-tier model from §1, not engine class names.
- **Contextual coach** that surfaces when the user makes a risky change (removed `Bankrupt` → "your game now has no way for corps to fold, are you sure?").

The wizard's text content is its own deliverable — needs round-by-round 18xx-domain prose, probably co-written with Anthony.

CSS / color audit is a hard prerequisite — the previous attempt invented class names with no styling. v1 must use the existing conventions from Companies/Trains/Mechanics panels.

---

## 10. Out of scope for v0

- The wizard's actual prose content (separate doc, probably with Anthony).
- The contextual coach trigger conditions and copy (also wizard-content scope).
- Drag-and-drop reorder mechanics within Group B (up/down arrows acceptable for v1; drag is a polish pass).
- Game-preset dropdown ("start from 1830 / 1846 / 1822 / blank") — likely yes, but not specified yet.
- Migration shim for legacy `state.mechanics.orSteps` toggles → new `rounds.<type>.steps` shape with provenance. Owned by Tim + Addy; needs to land alongside the inference engine.

---

## 11. Sequencing for the implementation

Once this doc is signed off:

1. **Cross-panel doc review pass** — Jenny, Farrah, Tim, Evan annotate §2 (inference rules) and §6 (feedback contract). Each owner adds rows / corrects cells.
2. **CSS / color guide audit** — I read the existing panel CSS, write a short style-conformance note before any rendering code.
3. **Static HTML mockup** of the Operating sub-tab matching §9 layout, using existing CSS classes only. Anthony review.
4. **Provenance schema + inference engine** — pure functions, no UI yet. Unit-testable on synthetic state.
5. **Wizard scaffolding** — content gets filled in iteratively; structure first.
6. **Wire it all together**, pull the placeholder out of `#stepsView`, ship.

No code lands on the panel between today and step 3.
